									<p>Lugia is a draconian,mythical Pokemon that possess avaian qualities . It has silver/white feathers over most of its body. It has 10 fins running along its back, which stand upward while it flys. The fins lie flat on its back in the water and on land.Lugia is a really powerful pokemon, here are the stats to prove it. Lugia has the ability called Pressure, which causes the opposing Pokemon to double its PP usage during battle. I would tell the opponenet to think atleast twice before facing this amazing and powerful pokemon! It also possess abilities like these. Lugia is so powerful that if it flaps its wings, it can  blow apart houses. That is the reason why it decides to live out of sight and deep under the sea. It also has this amazing ability to calm down raging storms. Its said that Lugia appears during storms!    </p>

If injured,it dips its body into the molten magma of a volcano so it could burn and heal itself. It is said that its apperance indicates that spring is coming. This to has the ability called pressure, like lugia,however possess a hidden ability called Flame Body. With full HP, you have a 0.4% chance of catching this majestic creature.

												<h3>Zapdos</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Zapdos is one of the three winged mirages alongside Articuno and Moltres. Zapdos is an avian pokemon with yellow plumage.Black rings encirlce its eyes,and it has a long and thin light orange beak. The most impressive stat about Zapdos is its speed and Sp.Atk. They are both a 100 or above. Zapdos gains energy and power by actually being struck by lightning bolt, so putting Pikachu against Zapdos will not be a good idea! It is said that the lightning caused by the flapping of its wings cause summer storms. For more information on this Electric and Flying pokemon, click the link below.

												<h3>Ho-Oh</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Ho-Oh,one of the strongest pokemon I have known. Ho-Oh is based on the legendary Phoenix,a creature of the Greek Mythology which is also known as Firebird. Many cultures hold the Phoenix symbol for Longevity,Ressurection and Reincarnation.It used its amazing powers to give new lif to Raikou,Entei and Suicune after they were perished in Ecrueteak City's Burned tower. It has been said that wherever a Ho-Oh flies, ab beautifulrainbow apperas behind it. This Pokemon has the strength to revive any pokemon, is incredibly fast and has a devastating Fire-Type attack called''Sacred Fire''. If you ask me, what is the best flying type pokemon, my answer would be Ho-Oh,the legendary Phoenix.</p>

Mew is covered with a layer of fine,pink hair which is only visible with the aid of a microscope.Mew has shor arms with three fingers on each paw with small,orange paw pads on the undersides of its feet.
